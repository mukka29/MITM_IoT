# A Survey on Man-In-The-Middle Attacks in IoT Devices

CMPSCI5794: Security of IoT Systems

# Introduction
Man-In-The-Middle-Attack (MITM), a well-known type of attack in the Internet of Things (IoT) and computer communication. In this attack, an attacker targets the data flow between the two communicating parties and tries to intercept the data by compromising its confidentiality and integrity. This attack has the capability to enable an attacker to direct the internet traffic to flow through the attacker machine. This survey presents explanation on some of the existing MITM attacks, weaknesses that led to MITM attack, statistics and some counter measures with a discussion between each type of weakness among the IoT devices.
